> You can't design a good layout if you don't know the content.

> Introducing new layouts for screen sizes where the content loses it's integrity.

> An early trap for us that I see many other falling into is the idea of "screen size" targeting. Setting breakpoints before you build can lead to some real pain when trying to squeeze in content later.

## Touch Events

* [Custom gesture](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/input/touch-input/touchevents/)

## Responsive Typography

* [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/)
* [Responsive line height](http://viljamis.com/blog/2014/responsive-line-height/)

As your site responds to various displays and devices, your type needs to maintain its integrity and adapt with the layout.

If your line lengths grow longer at larger breakpoints, your type size should increase too. Conversely, as your line lengths shorten, your type size can decrease.

## Media Queries

Style sheets with media queries attached to their `<link>` tags will still download even if it evaluate to `false`.

Use [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) for IE6-8. It supports only `min-width` and `max-width`, but that is enough to kick started.

```
<!--[if (lt IE 9)&(!IEMobile 7)]>
<script src="respond.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

```
if (window.matchMedia("(min-width: 40em)").matches) {
	// load stuff}
```

### Mobile-first

> My favoured way to work is what is termed "mobile first". This means that you start with the view of your site as it will be served to mobile device users, and work up from there, changing the layout to make best use of the additional screen real estate of tablet and desktop users. A benefit of working mobile first is that it forces you to consider the content hierarchy in order to give someone scrolling through your content the best reading experience. This can then inform your decisions on desktop - helping you and the people you work with to have clarity in terms of which elements should take visual priority in the design.

---

> To me, mobile first simply means forced prioritization. It means think about layout later. Start with a single column “design” (also known as a list), and force yourself to prioritize content and functionality with sequential ranking.

```
// Mobile-first style
// By default is width 100%, which is good for mobile-first
// Only when at least 800px do we apply the following styles
@media screen and (min-width: 50em) {
	.col {
		float: left;
		width: 50%;
	}
}

// Do not do desktop-first
.col {
	float: left;
	width: 50%;
}

// Device is at most 800px and not over this limit
@media screen and (max-width: 50em) {
	.col {
		float: none;
		width: auto;
	}
}
```

Get your thinking right first. Just because you develop using a desktop browser does not mean you need to think desktop-first!

## Retina

* [WWDC - Delivering web content on high resolution displays](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/?id=602)
* [json2css-sprite-mixins](https://github.com/bensmithett/json2css-sprite-mixins)
* [How I design for retina](https://medium.com/p/e905c9106a56)
* [Responsive retina blog design](http://paulstamatiou.com/responsive-retina-blog-design/)
* [Designer's guide to DPI](http://sebastien-gabriel.com/designers-guide-to-dpi/)
* [Responsive images](https://github.com/andismith/grunt-responsive-images)


```
.logo {
  width: 200px;
  height: 60px;
  background-image: url(logo.png) no-repeat;
  background-size: 100% 100%;

  // Or half it
  background-size: 100px 100px, 100% 100%;
}

@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
  .logo {
    background-image: url(logo@2x.png) no-repeat;

    // Or half it
    background-size: 50px 50px;
  }
}
```

Notice the `background-size` is set to `100%` for both width and height. This makes it easier to change our real `width` and `height`.

```
@media (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       (-o-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3/2),
       (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       (min-resolution: 1.5dppx) {
}
```
